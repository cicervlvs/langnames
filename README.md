The langnames package provides a consistent way to name languages in Linguistics documents. It comes with about 7500 pre-defined combinations of ISO 639-3 codes, names, and language families, pulled from the Glottolog and WALS databases.

To install the package, run:

`` latex langnames.ins``

More instructions in the package documentation, `langnames.pdf`.

**Warning**: there exists a risk of TexLive not recognizing the input files _ln\_langs*.tex_ and _ln\_fams*.tex_ as runtime files. I have tried to avoid this by prefixing the files with the _ln_ (short for _langnames_) identifier.

The langnames package provides a consistent way to name languages in Linguistics documents. It comes with about 7500 pre-defined combinations of ISO 639-3 codes, names, and language families, pulled from the Glottolog and WALS databases.

To install the package, run:

`` latex langnames.ins``

More instructions in the package documentation, [`langnames.pdf`](http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/langnames/langnames.pdf), which may also be generated by compiling `langnames.dtx`

It is important that the ln_* .tex files be installed in the same directory as langnames.sty, so as to avoid the risk of them not being recognized as runtime files.
